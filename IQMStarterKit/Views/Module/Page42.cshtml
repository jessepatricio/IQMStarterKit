        <p><strong>How did you do?</strong><br/>All five items in this test identified characteristics of assertive communication.  So high scores (20 or above) would indicate a high level of assertiveness.  Low scores (10 and below) would indicate a low level of assertiveness.</p>

        <p><strong>What will you do?</strong><br/>The remaining discussion in this chapter clarifies the nature of assertive communication and offers guidelines for increasing your own assertiveness.  Consider these suggestions as ways to increase your own assertiveness and at the same time to reduce your aggressive tendencies when appropriate.</p>
