            <p>How are you doing in terms of your personal leadership?  If you’re wondering what personal leadership is, here’s a definition. Personal leadership is the leadership of the self. It is the ability to define a direction for your leadership and life, and to move in that direction with consistency and clarity. </p>
            <p>When you practice personal leadership, you “lead from the inside out.” The process involves asking yourself, “How do I need to be, act and think in order to be my best?” To do that, you must periodically turn away from the concerns of the day – the people, the problems and the pressure – to explore and discover your inner edge. </p>
            <p>To practice personal leadership, you apply the principles of leadership that make businesses a success … to yourself. For example, leading in business involves having a compelling vision, developing strategies and inspiring people to use their talents to meet a goal for improved business results. Leading yourself means applying these same principles of leadership to your role as a leader and your life. You, too, need a compelling vision and a strategy for reaching it. You need a team supporting you. You need results, as well as a sense of contribution and purpose. The difference is that personal leadership doesn’t just make for better business; it makes for better leadership. It makes for a better you. </p>
            <p>When you practice personal leadership, you use every ounce of your potential with inspiration instead of perspiration, synergy instead of sacrifice and wisdom instead of work. Personal leadership is so important, in fact, that management expert Peter Drucker once called it “the only leadership that’s going to matter in the 21st century.” </p>
            <p>So now, the key question is, “Are you succeeding in leading yourself?” Take the following quiz to find out.</p>

            <p><strong><u>The Personal Leadership Quiz</u></strong></p>
